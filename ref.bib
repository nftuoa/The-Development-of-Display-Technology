               object of tracing, as far as possible, the cause of that
               difference, and whether it depends on the charged conductors
               principally, or on the interposed dielectric; and as it appears
               to be great in air and nitrogen (1476.), let us observe the
               phenomena in air first. 1481. The general case is best
               understood by a reference to surfaces of considerable size
               rather than to points, which involve (as a secondary effect) the
               formation of currents (1562.). My investigation, therefore, was
               carried on with balls and terminations of different diameters,

  abstract  = "486. When the spark from a good induction coil traverses a glass
               tube containing a rarefied gas, certain phenomena are observed
               which vary greatly with the kind of gas and the degree of
               exhaustion. There is one appearance, however, which is constant
               in all the gases which I have examined, and within very wide
               limits of pressure, viz.: the well-known dark space round the
               negative pole. I have long been impressed with the idea that
               this dark space coating the pole was in some way related to the
               layer of molecular pressure causing movement in the radiometer,
               and the following experiments were instituted with the object of
               testing this hypothesis. A glass bulb (fig. 1) was furnished w
               ith platinum wire terminals sealed into the glass, ending
               outside in loops and. inside in aluminium poles; the positive
               pole being a wire and the negative pole a disk about 10 millims.
               diameter, bare in front and covered with mica at the back. The
               bulb being full of dry air and connected with the Sprengel pump,
               was exhausted. An induction coil capable of giving sparks 68
               millims. long in air when actuated by 3 Grove's cells, was
               connected with the terminals, the disk being always negative
               except when otherwise stated.",
